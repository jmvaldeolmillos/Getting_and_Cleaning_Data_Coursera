This file describes how works the script **run_analysis.R**.  
These are the specifications required for the proper use of the script:  
1. Download and unzip de data from this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
2. Rename the folder with "data".  
3. Copy the data folder and the script **run_analysis.R** in your current working directory or create a new working directory and copy the files into it.  
4. Read the file **run_analysis.R** in Rstudio (is very important to have installed the dplyr library).  
5. This R script creates two files:  
	* *dataSetStep4.txt* (or csv): Dataset with 10299 rows and 68 cols. (Step4).  
	* *dataSetStep5.txt* (or csv): Dataset witn 180 rows and 68 cols. (Step5).  
6. To obtain the data in csv format, uncomment the line in the script.
